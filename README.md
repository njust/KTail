# Kubernetes log viewer

[![Linux Build](https://github.com/njust/KTail/actions/workflows/linux-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/njust/KTail/actions/workflows/linux-build.yml)

KTail allows you to tail multiple pods in one view. It automatically detects updates and attaches to new pods. Configurable highlighters show how often regular expressions matched and let you quickly navigate in the results.

- Multiple kubernetes configurations can be added
- Select a single pod via double click or multiple pods via Shift / Ctrl + Enter
